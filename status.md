Simon Arena

#### Project title

Website Outage Detector

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Layed out all the infrastructure for the code including the directory, all of the .py files, as well as the extensions that had to be installed to windows. On top of this, I have done testing for the notification system, and have that set up to be imnplemented into the project itself.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Most .py files are still just rough outlines for the code, and I have yet to test the notification system in conjunction with the outage detection.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Mostly just getting formatting set up, including the directory, and the installation process for some extentions took some time, but they got done in the end.
